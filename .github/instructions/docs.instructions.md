# Documentation instructions

When editing Markdown documentation:

1. Favor task-oriented language and concrete commands.
2. Keep sections scannable with short headings and bullets.
3. Ensure command examples are copy/paste ready.
4. Link related docs when introducing new workflow guidance.
5. Avoid duplicating long reference content unless needed for discoverability.
