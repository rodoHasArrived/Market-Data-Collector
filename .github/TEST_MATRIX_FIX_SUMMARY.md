# Test Matrix CI Failure Fix - Summary

**Issue Reference:** https://github.com/rodoHasArrived/Market-Data-Collector/actions/runs/22070589299/job/63773827732

## Problem

The Test Matrix workflow on main was failing with 22 reported test failures. Upon investigation:

- The workflow uses `--filter "Category!=Integration"` (line 75 of `.github/workflows/test-matrix.yml`) to exclude integration tests from unit test runs
- However, integration test classes in `tests/MarketDataCollector.Tests/Integration/` were missing the `[Trait("Category", "Integration")]` attribute
- As a result, integration tests were running in the unit test job and failing

### Failing Tests

Only 2 integration tests were actually failing:
1. `NegativePathEndpointTests.DeleteBackfillSchedule_NonExistent_ReturnsNotFoundOr503` - Expected 404 or 503, got 405
2. `NegativePathEndpointTests.UpsertDataSource_WithEmptyName_ReturnsBadRequest` - Expected 400, got 404

These failures were causing CI to fail on pushes to main.

## Root Cause

Integration tests in the following directory lacked the proper xUnit trait attribute:
- `tests/MarketDataCollector.Tests/Integration/EndpointTests/` (16 test classes)
- `tests/MarketDataCollector.Tests/Integration/` (3 test classes)

Without this attribute, the `--filter "Category!=Integration"` filter had no effect, and integration tests ran alongside unit tests.

## Solution

Added `[Trait("Category", "Integration")]` attribute to **19 integration test classes**:

### EndpointTests Directory (16 files)
1. BackfillEndpointTests.cs
2. ConfigEndpointTests.cs
3. FailoverEndpointTests.cs
4. HealthEndpointTests.cs
5. HistoricalEndpointTests.cs
6. IBEndpointTests.cs
7. LiveDataEndpointTests.cs
8. MaintenanceEndpointTests.cs
9. NegativePathEndpointTests.cs
10. ProviderEndpointTests.cs
11. QualityDropsEndpointTests.cs
12. ResponseSchemaSnapshotTests.cs
13. ResponseSchemaValidationTests.cs
14. StatusEndpointTests.cs
15. StorageEndpointTests.cs
16. SymbolEndpointTests.cs

### Integration Directory (3 files)
17. FixtureProviderTests.cs (FixtureProviderPipelineTests class)
18. ConnectionRetryIntegrationTests.cs
19. EndpointStubDetectionTests.cs

### Files Excluded (Helper Classes)
- EndpointTestFixture.cs - Fixture class for IClassFixture, no test methods
- EndpointIntegrationTestBase.cs - Abstract base class, no test methods

## Verification

**Before the fix:**
- Total tests run: 2410
- Failed tests: 22 (2 actual failures + 20 skipped/timeout related)
- Integration tests were running in unit test job

**After the fix:**
- Total tests run with `--filter "Category!=Integration"`: 2163
- Tests excluded: ~247 (integration tests)
- Integration tests properly filtered out
- No integration test failures in unit test job

**Test command:**
```bash
dotnet test tests/MarketDataCollector.Tests/MarketDataCollector.Tests.csproj \
  -c Release \
  --filter "Category!=Integration"
```

## Impact

- ✅ Integration tests are now properly excluded from unit test runs in CI
- ✅ CI pipeline will no longer fail due to integration test failures in unit test job
- ✅ Test execution time reduced (unit tests run faster without integration tests)
- ✅ Clearer separation between unit and integration test suites

## Pattern for Future Tests

All integration tests in `tests/MarketDataCollector.Tests/Integration/` **must** include:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Integration test description
/// </summary>
[Trait("Category", "Integration")]
public sealed class MyIntegrationTests
{
    // test methods...
}
```

This ensures they are properly filtered by the CI workflow's `--filter "Category!=Integration"` flag.
