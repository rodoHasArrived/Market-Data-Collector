## Usage Tips

### For Developers

1. **Before Opening a PR**:
   ```bash
   # Format code locally
   dotnet format MarketDataCollector.sln

   # Run tests
   dotnet test
   ```

2. **Triggering Workflows Manually**:
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Select workflow
   - Click "Run workflow"

3. **Understanding PR Status Checks**:
   - All checks must pass before merge
   - Review AI-generated PR review summary for risk assessment
   - Review dependency review and security scan summaries
   - Check code coverage reports in Codecov uploads

### For Maintainers

1. **Creating a Release**:
   - Use "Release Management" workflow
   - Provide semantic version (e.g., `v1.6.0`)
   - Mark as pre-release if needed
   - Workflow handles tagging and triggering builds

2. **Security Monitoring**:
   - Check Security tab regularly
   - Review Dependabot PRs promptly
   - CodeQL runs on the weekly security schedule or manual full scans
   - Review AI vulnerability assessments in workflow summaries

3. **Managing Stale Items**:
   - Workflow runs automatically
   - Exempt important items with labels
   - Review and respond to stale warnings

## Best Practices

1. **Keep workflows fast**: Use caching and parallel jobs
2. **Fail fast**: Critical checks should fail quickly
3. **Clear feedback**: Provide actionable error messages
4. **Security first**: All code changes go through multiple security scans
5. **AI-assisted**: AI analysis supplements but never blocks workflows
6. **Automated maintenance**: Let workflows handle routine tasks
7. **Documentation**: Keep this README updated with workflow changes

## Maintenance

### Adding a New Workflow

1. Create workflow file in `.github/workflows/`
2. Test with `workflow_dispatch` trigger first
3. Consider adding AI analysis using `actions/ai-inference@v1`
4. Update this README with workflow documentation
5. Add to workflow dependencies diagram if applicable

### Modifying Existing Workflows

1. Test changes in a feature branch
2. Review workflow run logs for issues
3. Update documentation if behavior changes
4. Consider backward compatibility

### Debugging Workflows

1. Enable debug logging:
   ```yaml
   env:
     ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG: true
     ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
   ```

2. Use workflow artifacts for debugging
3. Check workflow run logs in Actions tab
4. Test locally with `act` tool when possible
