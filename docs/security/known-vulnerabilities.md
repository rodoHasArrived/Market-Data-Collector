# Known Vulnerabilities

This document tracks known security vulnerabilities in dependencies that have been assessed and accepted with documented mitigations.

## Accepted Vulnerabilities

### DotNetZip 1.16.0 - Path Traversal (GHSA-xhg6-9j5j-w4vf)

**CVE:** CVE-2024-48510  
**Severity:** High  
**Advisory:** https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xhg6-9j5j-w4vf

**Description:**  
DotNetZip 1.16.0 contains a path traversal vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code by crafting malicious paths in zip archives.

**Source:**  
Transitive dependency from QuantConnect.Lean packages (required for backtesting integration):
- QuantConnect.Lean 2.5.17414
- QuantConnect.Lean.Engine 2.5.17414
- QuantConnect.Common 2.5.17414
- QuantConnect.Indicators 2.5.17414

**Status:**  
- **No fix available** - DotNetZip is deprecated and no longer maintained
- **Cannot be upgraded** - Baked into QuantConnect.Lean binary dependencies
- **Alternative:** ProDotNetZip 1.19.0+ has a fix, but cannot be used as a drop-in replacement for transitive dependencies

**Risk Assessment:**  
**LOW** - Vulnerability requires extracting user-provided zip files, which is not a use case in this application.

**Mitigations:**
1. Application does not accept or extract user-provided zip files
2. All zip file operations are internal (data packaging/archival) with trusted sources
3. No code paths expose zip extraction to external input
4. QuantConnect integration is isolated and does not process untrusted archives

**Remediation Plan:**
- Monitor QuantConnect.Lean releases for updated DotNetZip dependency
- Consider submitting PR to QuantConnect to update their dependency
- Re-evaluate if application requirements change to include zip extraction from external sources
