## Contributing

When adding TODO comments, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Link to GitHub Issues**: Use `// TODO: Track with issue #123` format
2. **Be Descriptive**: Explain what needs to be done and why
3. **Use Correct Type**:
   - `TODO` - General tasks
   - `FIXME` - Bugs that need fixing
   - `HACK` - Temporary workarounds
   - `NOTE` - Important information

Example:
```csharp
// TODO: Track with issue #123 - Implement retry logic for transient failures
// This is needed because the API occasionally returns 503 errors during peak load.
```
