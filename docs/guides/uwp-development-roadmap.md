- Use the established CardStyle and theme resources
- Maintain consistent spacing (24px page margins, 16px element spacing)
- Leverage Community Toolkit controls where applicable

### Performance Considerations
- Real-time visualizations should implement throttling
- Large datasets should use virtualized lists
- Consider background thread processing for analytics
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data

### Accessibility
- Ensure all new controls are keyboard navigable
- Provide high contrast theme support
- Include screen reader descriptions
- Follow Windows accessibility guidelines
