# MarketDataCollector.UWP — Comprehensive Code Audit Report

**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Auditor:** Claude (Automated Architecture & Code Quality Audit)
**Scope:** `src/MarketDataCollector.Uwp/` — 47 Views, 5 ViewModels, 31 Services, 8 Controls, 3 Helpers/Converters
**Total UWP LOC:** ~40,000+ (22,169 in code-behind alone)

---

## Executive Summary

The MarketDataCollector.UWP application demonstrates solid functionality and thoughtful feature design, but suffers from **systemic architectural issues** that impair testability, maintainability, and scalability. The core problems are:

1. **Hybrid DI Transition (Partial Adoption)** — `ServiceLocator` + `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` are now present, but most call sites still use static `.Instance`
2. **Massive MVVM Violations** — 47 View code-behind files contain business logic; only 5 ViewModels exist
3. **Legacy Singleton Coupling** — 27 services still expose static singleton access and are consumed directly from Views/ViewModels
4. **22,169 lines of code-behind** that should be in ViewModels
5. **296 `async void` methods** across 44 files
6. **1 blocking async call** (`.GetAwaiter().GetResult()`) that can cause deadlocks

These issues don't block the application from working, but they create compounding technical debt that makes the codebase increasingly difficult to maintain, test, and extend.

---

## SECTION 1: ARCHITECTURAL FOUNDATION AUDIT

### 1.1 Layer Separation & Abstraction Clarity

**Rating: POOR**

The application has the right directory structure (Views, ViewModels, Services, Contracts, Models) but the boundaries are severely breached:

#### Finding 1.1.1: Code-Behind Contains Business Logic (CRITICAL)

**47 View code-behind files** average 472 lines each. The top offenders:

| File | Lines | Issue |
|------|-------|-------|
| `DashboardPage.xaml.cs` | 1,210 | Data collection control, sparkline management, symbol management, activity feed, integrity events — all in code-behind |
| `SettingsPage.xaml.cs` | 826 | Config reading/writing, credential management, validation logic |
| `SymbolsPage.xaml.cs` | 856 | Symbol CRUD, search, filtering, batch operations |
| `RetentionAssurancePage.xaml.cs` | 733 | Data retention policy logic, file scanning, reporting |
| `ScheduleManagerPage.xaml.cs` | 808 | CRON schedule creation, validation, execution management |
| `ChartingPage.xaml.cs` | 769 | Chart rendering, data transformation, indicator calculations |
| `StorageOptimizationPage.xaml.cs` | 641 | Storage analysis, compression, optimization logic |
| `BackfillPage.xaml.cs` | 694 | Backfill orchestration, provider selection, progress tracking |

**Example violation** (`DashboardPage.xaml.cs:491-509`):
```csharp
private async void QuickStartCollector_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    _isCollectorRunning = true;        // State management in code-behind
    _isCollectorPaused = false;
    _collectorStartTime = DateTime.UtcNow;
    _startTime = DateTime.UtcNow;
    UpdateCollectorStatus();           // UI + business logic interleaved
    UpdateQuickActionsCollectorStatus();
    UpdateStreamStatusBadges();
    await ShowInfoBarAsync(...);
}
```

This method manages application state, collector lifecycle, and UI updates — all concerns that should be in a ViewModel.

#### Finding 1.1.2: Views Bypass ViewModels Entirely

`DashboardPage` creates a `MainViewModel` but simultaneously maintains its own parallel state:
- `_isCollectorRunning`, `_isCollectorPaused` (duplicated from `DashboardViewModel`)
- `_tradesStreamCount`, `_depthStreamCount`, `_quotesStreamCount` (parallel tracking)
- `_publishedHistory[]`, `_droppedHistory[]`, `_integrityHistory[]` (sparkline data)
- `_configService`, `_activityFeedService`, `_integrityEventsService` (direct service access)

**Location:** `DashboardPage.xaml.cs:36-80`

The page has a `ViewModel` property of type `MainViewModel`, but most of the actual work happens in code-behind fields and methods, rendering the ViewModel largely decorative.

### 1.2 Dependency Injection & Service Composition

**Rating: CONCERNING (IMPROVED FROM CRITICAL)**

#### Finding 1.2.1: DI Container Exists, But Mostly Wraps Legacy Singletons

The project now initializes `ServiceLocator` in `App.xaml.cs` and registers services using `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`. However, registrations primarily return existing singleton instances, so runtime behavior is still mostly service-locator driven:

```csharp
// Pattern still repeated across much of the codebase
private static ConnectionService? _instance;
private static readonly object _lock = new();

public static ConnectionService Instance
{
    get
    {
        if (_instance == null)
        {
            lock (_lock)
            {
                _instance ??= new ConnectionService();
            }
        }
        return _instance;
    }
}
```

**Services using this pattern (27 total in `Services/`):**
`ConnectionService`, `ConfigService`, `StatusService`, `NotificationService`, `ThemeService`, `NavigationService`, `LoggingService`, `MessagingService`, `WatchlistService`, `ArchiveHealthService`, `RetentionAssuranceService`, `PendingOperationsQueueService`, `OfflineTrackingPersistenceService`, `BackgroundTaskSchedulerService`, `StorageService`, `AdvancedAnalyticsService`, `UwpAnalysisExportService`, `AdminMaintenanceService`, `FormValidationService`, `ExportPresetService`, `KeyboardShortcutService`, `SchemaService`, `TooltipService`, `WorkspaceService`, `UwpDataQualityService`, `ContextMenuService`, `InfoBarService`

**Impact:**
- DI composition is available but not the default usage path in most Views/ViewModels
- Service lifetimes are centrally registered, but static access bypasses constructor injection benefits
- Circular dependencies remain harder to detect because of mixed access patterns
- Initialization order is improved at startup but still coupled to singleton initialization

#### Finding 1.2.2: Inconsistent Service Resolution

Service construction is now mostly standardized; only limited direct `new` service construction remains:

```csharp
// Remaining direct construction path (ArchiveHealthService.cs)
_configService = new ConfigService();

```

**1 known location** still creates `new ConfigService()` instead of using the registered singleton (`ArchiveHealthService.cs:47`).

This remaining inconsistency can still diverge config state in edge cases and should be normalized.

#### Finding 1.2.3: Interface Coverage Improved, But Injection Usage Is Limited

There are now **10 service interfaces** in `Contracts/`, and `ServiceLocator` registers abstractions such as `IConfigService`, `IConnectionService`, and `INavigationService`.

However, many call sites still reference concrete singletons directly:
```csharp
// App.xaml.cs:56
ConnectionService.Instance.StartMonitoring();

// DashboardViewModel.cs:131
_connectionService = ConnectionService.Instance;
```

Interface-first constructor injection is available, but not yet the dominant pattern across pages.

### 1.3 MVVM Pattern Consistency

**Rating: POOR**

#### Finding 1.3.1: Severe ViewModel Deficit

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| View code-behind files | 47 |
| ViewModel files | 5 |
| Views with a dedicated ViewModel | ~3 |
| Views with logic in code-behind | ~44 |

Only 5 ViewModels exist:
1. `MainViewModel.cs` (155 lines) — partially used by DashboardPage
2. `DashboardViewModel.cs` (494 lines) — exists but DashboardPage doesn't use it effectively
3. `BackfillViewModel.cs` — used by BackfillPage
4. `DataExportViewModel.cs` — used by DataExportPage
5. `DataQualityViewModel.cs` — used by DataQualityPage

The remaining **42 pages** have all their logic in code-behind.

#### Finding 1.3.2: CommunityToolkit.Mvvm Is Correctly Used Where Present

The existing ViewModels properly use CommunityToolkit.Mvvm patterns:
- `[ObservableProperty]` source generators for INPC
- `[RelayCommand]` for ICommand generation
- `ObservableObject` base class

This is a good foundation — the pattern just needs to be applied to the other 42 pages.

#### Finding 1.3.3: Duplicate Logic Between MainViewModel and DashboardViewModel

Both `MainViewModel` and `DashboardViewModel` contain:
- Provider description logic (`UpdateProviderDescription()`)
- Status refresh logic (`RefreshStatusAsync()`)
- Symbol management (`Symbols` collection)
- Data source selection (`SelectedDataSource`)

**Location:** `MainViewModel.cs:103-110` and `DashboardViewModel.cs:186-195`

---

## SECTION 2: REAL-TIME MARKET DATA PIPELINE AUDIT

### 2.1 Data Flow Architecture & Responsiveness

**Rating: MODERATE**

#### Finding 2.1.1: Simulated/Demo Data Throughout

Multiple pages use `Random` to generate fake data instead of consuming real data streams:

```csharp
// DashboardPage.xaml.cs:264
_publishedHistory[_sparklineIndex] = 800 + _random.Next(0, 400);

// DashboardPage.xaml.cs:378
var latency = 8 + _random.Next(0, 10);

// DashboardPage.xaml.cs:937-939
StorageUsedText.Text = "2.4 GB";       // Hard-coded demo values
DataQualityText.Text = "99.8%";
AvgLatencyText.Text = "12ms";
```

**Files with demo/simulated data:**
- `DashboardPage.xaml.cs` (sparklines, latency, quick stats)
- `LiveDataViewerPage.xaml.cs` (quote data)
- `OrderBookPage.xaml.cs` (order book levels)
- `ChartingPage.xaml.cs` (chart data)

This makes it difficult to distinguish between real implementation and placeholder code.

#### Finding 2.1.2: Good Use of DispatcherQueue for UI Thread Marshalling

Where service events trigger UI updates, `DispatcherQueue.TryEnqueue` is correctly used:

```csharp
// DashboardPage.xaml.cs:896-904
private void ActivityFeedService_ActivityAdded(object? sender, ActivityItem e)
{
    DispatcherQueue.TryEnqueue(() =>
    {
        _activityItems.Insert(0, CreateActivityDisplayItem(e));
        while (_activityItems.Count > 5)
        {
            _activityItems.RemoveAt(_activityItems.Count - 1);
        }
    });
}
```

This is a good pattern consistently applied across the pages.

### 2.2 Real-Time Binding Performance

**Rating: MODERATE**

#### Finding 2.2.1: Good Sparkline Optimization

The circular buffer pattern for sparkline data is well-implemented:
- Fixed-size arrays with O(1) insert/read
- Reusable `PointCollection` instances to avoid allocations
- Static cached brushes to prevent repeated `SolidColorBrush` creation

**Location:** `DashboardPage.xaml.cs:43-58, 297-334`

#### Finding 2.2.2: Unified Timer Replaces Multiple Timers

The DashboardPage consolidates 3 timers into a single unified timer with tick-count-based dispatching:

```csharp
// Single 500ms timer with cascading intervals
_unifiedTimer = new DispatcherTimer { Interval = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(500) };
// Sparklines: every tick (500ms)
// Uptime: every 2 ticks (1s)
// Refresh: every 4 ticks (2s)
```

This is a good performance optimization. However, it's implemented in code-behind rather than a ViewModel.

### 2.3 Thread Safety & Async Patterns

**Rating: CONCERNING**

#### Finding 2.3.1: Blocking Async Call (CRITICAL)

One instance of `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()` that can cause deadlocks:

```csharp
// ArchiveHealthService.cs:422
var analytics = analyticsService.GetAnalyticsAsync(false).GetAwaiter().GetResult();
```

This violates the project's own rules and can deadlock the UI thread.

#### Finding 2.3.2: 296 `async void` Methods

While most are UI event handlers (where `async void` is acceptable), the sheer volume indicates over-reliance on event-driven patterns rather than command-driven MVVM patterns. Notable non-event-handler `async void` methods exist in `TaskExtensions.cs`.

#### Finding 2.3.3: Fire-and-Forget in App Lifecycle

```csharp
// App.xaml.cs:32
protected override void OnLaunched(LaunchActivatedEventArgs args)
{
    _ = SafeOnLaunchedAsync(); // Fire-and-forget
}
```

While this is wrapped in try/catch, the `_ =` pattern means unhandled exceptions during startup may be silently swallowed. The error recovery (creating a basic window) is good defensive programming.

#### Finding 2.3.4: Timer Callback Without UI Thread Marshalling

```csharp
// DashboardViewModel.cs:428-431
private void OnRefreshTimerElapsed(object? sender, System.Timers.ElapsedEventArgs e)
{
    _ = SafeRefreshTimerWorkAsync();
}
```

`System.Timers.Timer` fires on a thread pool thread. The `SafeRefreshTimerWorkAsync` method updates `[ObservableProperty]` fields, which trigger INPC. If bindings exist, this could cause cross-thread exceptions on the UI thread. The code-behind's `DispatcherTimer` approach is safer.

---

## SECTION 3: CODE QUALITY & MAINTAINABILITY AUDIT

### 3.1 Duplication & Reusability

**Rating: POOR**

#### Finding 3.1.1: Repeated Page Initialization Pattern (~40+ files)

Nearly every page follows this identical pattern:

```csharp
public SomePage()
{
    InitializeComponent();
    _configService = ConfigService.Instance;        // mostly standardized now
    _someOtherService = SomeService.Instance;
    Loaded += SomePage_Loaded;
    Unloaded += SomePage_Unloaded;
}

private async void SomePage_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    await LoadDataAsync();
}

private void SomePage_Unloaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    // cleanup
}
```

**LOC savings if extracted to a base class:** ~200-400 lines across the project.

#### Finding 3.1.2: Duplicate Provider Description Logic

`UpdateProviderDescription()` is implemented identically in:
- `MainViewModel.cs:103-110`
- `DashboardViewModel.cs:186-195`
- `DashboardPage.xaml.cs` (implicit through ViewModel)

#### Finding 3.1.3: Duplicate InfoBar/Error Handling Pattern

The `ShowInfoBarAsync` / `ShowErrorAsync` / `ShowExceptionErrorAsync` pattern is repeated across multiple pages. While `InfoBarService` exists as a static helper, each page still implements its own InfoBar management.

#### Finding 3.1.4: Sample Data Generation Duplicated

Multiple pages generate their own sample/demo data in nearly identical patterns:
- `DashboardPage.xaml.cs:828-871` — sample activities
- `DashboardPage.xaml.cs:964-1008` — sample integrity events
- Similar patterns in LiveDataViewerPage, OrderBookPage, ChartingPage

### 3.2 Code Clarity & Complexity

**Rating: MODERATE**

#### Finding 3.2.1: Overly Large Methods

Methods exceeding 50 lines:
- `DashboardPage.QuickAddSymbol_Click` — 128 lines (659-787)
- `DashboardPage.DashboardPage_Loaded` — effectively chains 8 method calls
- `ConnectionService.ReconnectWithExponentialBackoffAsync` — 86 lines (340-426)
- `CredentialService.cs` — multiple methods > 100 lines
- `BackgroundTaskSchedulerService.cs` — scheduler logic is complex

#### Finding 3.2.2: Display Models Defined in Code-Behind Files

`ActivityDisplayItem` and `IntegrityEventDisplayItem` are defined at the bottom of `DashboardPage.xaml.cs`:

```csharp
// DashboardPage.xaml.cs:1206-1228
public class ActivityDisplayItem { ... }
public class IntegrityEventDisplayItem { ... }
```

These should be in separate files in the `Models/` directory.

### 3.3 Error Handling & Logging

**Rating: MODERATE-GOOD**

#### Finding 3.3.1: Good Exception Handling Pattern

Most async event handlers use try/catch with user-friendly error display:

```csharp
catch (Exception ex)
{
    await ShowExceptionErrorAsync(ex, "stopping collector");
}
```

The `InfoBarService.CreateErrorDetails()` method provides structured error information.

#### Finding 3.3.2: Silent Exception Swallowing

Some catch blocks silently swallow exceptions:

```csharp
// App.xaml.cs:229-233
catch
{
    // Continue even if first-run setup fails
}
```

While intentional (app resilience), this makes debugging startup issues difficult. These should at minimum write to `Debug.WriteLine`.

#### Finding 3.3.3: `Debug.WriteLine` Instead of Structured Logging

Many places use `System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine` for logging:

```csharp
// App.xaml.cs:72
System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine($"[App] Error during application launch: {ex.Message}");
```

While `LoggingService` exists, it's not consistently used everywhere. Debug output disappears in release builds.

---

## SECTION 4: EXTENSIBILITY & DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE AUDIT

### 4.1 Plugin & Strategy Pattern Support

**Rating: POOR**

#### Finding 4.1.1: No Extension Points

Adding a new data source requires modifying:
1. `ConnectionService` — hard-coded provider logic
2. `ConfigService` — configuration handling
3. `SettingsPage` — UI for provider configuration
4. `DashboardPage` — provider description switch expression

There is no plugin architecture, strategy pattern, or provider registry in the UWP project.

#### Finding 4.1.2: Navigation Is Hard-Coded

All 47 page types are registered in `NavigationService.RegisterPages()` with hard-coded string-to-Type mappings. Adding a page requires modifying the navigation service.

### 4.2 Configuration & Environment Management

**Rating: GOOD**

#### Finding 4.2.1: ConfigService Properly Abstracts Configuration

Configuration is loaded from a JSON file with proper async patterns:
- `ConfigService.LoadConfigAsync()` — reads from file
- `ConfigService.SaveConfigAsync()` — writes to file
- `ConfigService.ValidateConfigAsync()` — validates structure

API credentials are **not** stored in config files — they use environment variables or the credential service.

### 4.3 Testing & Testability

**Rating: CONCERNING (IMPROVED FROM CRITICAL)**

#### Finding 4.3.1: ViewModels Are Untestable Due to Singleton Dependencies

```csharp
// DashboardViewModel.cs:131-136
_connectionService = ConnectionService.Instance;    // Hard singleton
_statusService = StatusService.Instance;             // Hard singleton
_schedulerService = BackgroundTaskSchedulerService.Instance;
_activityFeedService = ActivityFeedService.Instance;
_sessionService = CollectionSessionService.Instance;
_configService = ConfigService.Instance;
```

No ViewModel accepts interfaces via constructor injection. All depend on concrete singleton instances. Unit testing requires either:
- Reflection to replace static instances (fragile)
- Running actual services (integration test, not unit test)

#### Finding 4.3.2: Only 1 UWP Integration Test Exists

`tests/MarketDataCollector.Tests/Integration/UwpCoreIntegrationTests.cs` exists but tests the shared contracts, not UWP-specific logic. There are **zero unit tests** for any UWP ViewModel or Service.

#### Finding 4.3.3: Interface Coverage Is Minimal

There are now 10 UWP service interfaces in `Contracts/` (for example: `IAdminMaintenanceService`, `IAdvancedAnalyticsService`, `IConnectionService`, `INavigationService`, `IStorageService`).

Coverage has improved, but interface-driven constructor injection is still limited in page/viewmodel call sites.

---

## SECTION 5: USER EXPERIENCE & FEATURE COMPLETENESS AUDIT

### 5.1 Real-Time Data Visualization

**Rating: MODERATE-GOOD**

#### Finding 5.1.1: Good Visual Design Infrastructure

The application includes:
- 8 custom controls (`AlertBanner`, `DataCoverageCalendar`, `DataTable`, `LoadingOverlay`, `MetricCard`, `ProgressCard`, `SectionHeader`, `StatusBadge`)
- 3 XAML style files (`AppStyles.xaml`, `Animations.xaml`, `IconResources.xaml`)
- `BrushRegistry` for consistent theming
- `ThemeService` for dark/light mode

#### Finding 5.1.2: Stale Data Indicators Could Be Improved

The dashboard shows connection status and latency, but individual data streams don't show per-symbol freshness timestamps. Users cannot distinguish which specific symbols have stale data.

### 5.2 Navigation & Accessibility

**Rating: MODERATE**

#### Finding 5.2.1: 47 Pages May Be Excessive

The application has 47 distinct pages. While each serves a purpose, the navigation depth is significant. Consider consolidating related pages or using tabbed interfaces for related functionality.

#### Finding 5.2.2: Accessibility Helper Exists

`AccessibilityHelper.cs` and `ResponsiveLayoutHelper.cs` exist, which is positive. However, accessibility is not consistently applied across all 47 pages.

### 5.3 Error Messages & User Communication

**Rating: GOOD**

#### Finding 5.3.1: InfoBar System Is Well-Designed

The `InfoBarService` provides:
- Severity-based auto-dismiss timers (3s success, 10s error)
- Structured error details with context and remedy suggestions
- `CreateErrorDetails` for exception-to-user-message translation

This is one of the better-designed subsystems in the UWP project.

---

## SECTION 6: PERFORMANCE & SCALABILITY AUDIT

### 6.1 Memory Management

**Rating: MODERATE**

#### Finding 6.1.1: Good Event Cleanup on Page Unload

Most pages properly unsubscribe from events in the `Unloaded` handler:

```csharp
private void DashboardPage_Unloaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    _unifiedTimer.Stop();
    _unifiedTimer.Tick -= UnifiedTimer_Tick;
    _activityFeedService.ActivityAdded -= ActivityFeedService_ActivityAdded;
    _integrityEventsService.EventRecorded -= IntegrityEventsService_EventRecorded;
    _integrityEventsService.EventsCleared -= IntegrityEventsService_EventsCleared;
}
```

#### Finding 6.1.2: DashboardViewModel Properly Implements IDisposable

```csharp
public void Dispose()
{
    if (_disposed) return;
    _refreshTimer.Stop();
    _refreshTimer.Dispose();
    _connectionService.ConnectionStateChanged -= OnConnectionStateChanged;
    // ... all event handlers unsubscribed
    _disposed = true;
}
```

However, `DashboardPage` creates but never calls `Dispose()` on the ViewModel.

#### Finding 6.1.3: BoundedObservableCollection Prevents Unbounded Growth

The `BoundedObservableCollection<T>` and `CircularBuffer<T>` from the shared library are used in ViewModels:

```csharp
public BoundedObservableCollection<ActivityItem> RecentActivities { get; } = new(5);
```

This prevents memory leaks from unbounded collection growth.

### 6.2 Throughput & Latency

**Rating: MODERATE-GOOD**

#### Finding 6.2.1: Good Performance Optimizations Present

- Static cached brushes avoid repeated `SolidColorBrush` allocations
- Circular buffers use O(1) operations
- Unified timer reduces timer overhead
- `HttpClientFactory` integration (via `Microsoft.Extensions.Http`)

#### Finding 6.2.2: XAML Uses `{Binding}` Instead of `x:Bind`

The project uses WinUI 3 `{Binding}` markup extensions rather than compiled `x:Bind`. While `x:Bind` is faster due to compile-time resolution, this is a minor concern unless high-frequency UI updates are needed.

### 6.3 Graceful Shutdown

**Rating: GOOD**

#### Finding 6.3.1: Parallel Service Shutdown with Timeout

```csharp
// App.xaml.cs:148-157
var shutdownTasks = new[]
{
    ShutdownServiceAsync(() => BackgroundTaskSchedulerService.Instance.StopAsync(), ...),
    ShutdownServiceAsync(() => PendingOperationsQueueService.Instance.ShutdownAsync(), ...),
    ShutdownServiceAsync(() => OfflineTrackingPersistenceService.Instance.ShutdownAsync(), ...),
    ShutdownServiceAsync(() => ConnectionService.Instance.StopMonitoring(), ...)
};
await Task.WhenAll(shutdownTasks);
```

Services are shut down in parallel with a 5-second timeout. This is well-designed.

---

## PRIORITIZED IMPROVEMENT ROADMAP

### CRITICAL ISSUES (Block testability, pose reliability risks)

#### C1: Complete DI-First Migration

- **Finding:** DI container now exists (`ServiceLocator` + `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`), but usage is still dominated by static singleton access
- **Location:** `App.xaml.cs`, `Services/ServiceLocator.cs`, all ViewModels/pages still using `.Instance`
- **Current Pattern:**
  ```csharp
  _connectionService = ConnectionService.Instance;
  ```
- **Recommended Fix:** Move from compatibility registrations to constructor-injected interfaces as the primary path:
  ```csharp
  // App.xaml.cs
  var services = new ServiceCollection();
  services.AddSingleton<IConnectionService, ConnectionService>();
  services.AddSingleton<IConfigService, ConfigService>();
  // ... register all services
  var provider = services.BuildServiceProvider();

  // ViewModels receive dependencies via constructor
  public DashboardViewModel(IConnectionService connection, IConfigService config) { }
  ```
- **Effort:** 2-3 days
- **Risk:** Medium — requires touching many constructors and navigation paths. Mitigate with incremental rollout.
- **Dependency:** Should continue in parallel with H1/H2.

#### C2: Fix Blocking Async Call

- **Finding:** `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()` in `ArchiveHealthService.cs:422`
- **Location:** `src/MarketDataCollector.Uwp/Services/ArchiveHealthService.cs:422`
- **Current Code:**
  ```csharp
  var analytics = analyticsService.GetAnalyticsAsync(false).GetAwaiter().GetResult();
  ```
- **Recommended Fix:**
  ```csharp
  var analytics = await analyticsService.GetAnalyticsAsync(false);
  ```
- **Effort:** 30 minutes
- **Risk:** Low — straightforward async conversion

#### C3: Fix Inconsistent Service Instantiation

- **Finding:** 1 remaining location creates `new ConfigService()` instead of using the registered singleton
- **Location:** `src/MarketDataCollector.Uwp/Services/ArchiveHealthService.cs:47`
- **Recommended Fix:** Replace direct construction with DI/service-locator resolution for consistency
- **Effort:** 30 minutes
- **Risk:** Low — direct replacement

---

### HIGH-IMPACT IMPROVEMENTS (Major architecture/maintainability gains)

#### H1: Extract ViewModels for Top 10 Code-Behind Files

- **Category:** Modularity, Testability
- **Finding:** 22,169 LOC in code-behind; top 10 files still remain very large
- **Location:** `DashboardPage`, `SettingsPage`, `SymbolsPage`, `RetentionAssurancePage`, `ScheduleManagerPage`, `ChartingPage`, `StorageOptimizationPage`, `BackfillPage`, `NotificationCenterPage`, `WatchlistPage`
- **Recommended Pattern:** Extract all business logic, state, and service interactions into ViewModels using CommunityToolkit.Mvvm (already a dependency). Code-behind should only contain:
  - `InitializeComponent()`
  - `DataContext = viewModel`
  - Purely visual event handlers (animations, layout)
- **Expected Benefit:** ~8,000 LOC moved to testable ViewModels. Estimated 70% reduction in code-behind for these files.
- **Effort:** 8-12 days
- **Dependencies:** C1 migration should continue in parallel

#### H2: Define Interfaces for All Services

- **Category:** Testability, Extensibility
- **Finding:** Interface coverage has improved to 10 UWP service interfaces, but many services/pages still bypass interface injection
- **Location:** `src/MarketDataCollector.Uwp/Contracts/`
- **Recommended Pattern:** Create `I{ServiceName}` interface for each service, extracting the public API. Move to `Contracts/` directory.
- **Expected Benefit:** Enables unit testing with mocks; enables DI registration by interface
- **Effort:** 3-4 days
- **Dependencies:** Should be done alongside or before C1

#### H3: Consolidate Duplicate MainViewModel and DashboardViewModel

- **Category:** Clarity, Consistency
- **Finding:** Both ViewModels have overlapping responsibilities (provider description, status refresh, symbol management)
- **Location:** `ViewModels/MainViewModel.cs`, `ViewModels/DashboardViewModel.cs`
- **Recommended Pattern:** Merge into a single `DashboardViewModel` that is the authoritative ViewModel for the dashboard page. Remove `MainViewModel` or repurpose it as a shell ViewModel for the main window.
- **Expected Benefit:** Eliminates ~100 lines of duplicate code and removes confusion about which ViewModel owns dashboard state
- **Effort:** 1-2 days
- **Dependencies:** H1

#### H4: Create Base Page Class for Common Patterns

- **Category:** Duplication Reduction
- **Finding:** 44 pages repeat the same initialization/cleanup pattern
- **Recommended Pattern:**
  ```csharp
  public abstract class DataPage<TViewModel> : Page where TViewModel : ObservableObject
  {
      protected TViewModel ViewModel { get; }
      protected DataPage(TViewModel viewModel)
      {
          ViewModel = viewModel;
          DataContext = viewModel;
          Loaded += OnPageLoaded;
          Unloaded += OnPageUnloaded;
      }
      protected virtual Task OnLoadedAsync() => Task.CompletedTask;
      protected virtual void OnCleanup() { }
  }
  ```
- **Expected Benefit:** ~400 LOC eliminated; consistent lifecycle management
- **Effort:** 2-3 days
- **Dependencies:** H1

---

### MEDIUM-IMPACT IMPROVEMENTS (Code quality, maintainability)

#### M1: Replace Demo/Simulated Data with Data Source Abstraction

- **Category:** Clarity, Testability
- **Finding:** Random-generated data in DashboardPage makes real vs. demo code indistinguishable
- **Recommended Fix:** Create `ISampleDataProvider` that can be swapped between demo and live data sources via configuration. Demo data should be explicit, not embedded in page logic.
- **Effort:** 2-3 days

#### M2: Extract Display Models from Code-Behind to Models Directory

- **Category:** Organization
- **Finding:** `ActivityDisplayItem`, `IntegrityEventDisplayItem`, `RunningTaskInfo` defined in code-behind files
- **Recommended Fix:** Move to `Models/` directory as separate files
- **Effort:** 2-3 hours

#### M3: Standardize Logging to Use LoggingService Consistently

- **Category:** Observability
- **Finding:** Mix of `Debug.WriteLine` and `LoggingService.Instance.Log*`
- **Recommended Fix:** Replace all `Debug.WriteLine` with `LoggingService` calls. Ensure LoggingService writes to Debug output in debug builds.
- **Effort:** 3-4 hours

#### M4: Address Thread Safety in DashboardViewModel Timer

- **Category:** Reliability
- **Finding:** `System.Timers.Timer` callback updates `[ObservableProperty]` fields from thread pool thread
- **Recommended Fix:** Switch to `DispatcherTimer` (as DashboardPage already does) or add `DispatcherQueue.TryEnqueue` around property updates
- **Effort:** 1-2 hours

#### M5: Add CancellationToken Support to All Async Service Methods

- **Category:** Reliability
- **Finding:** Many async methods don't accept `CancellationToken`, preventing graceful cancellation
- **Recommended Fix:** Add `CancellationToken ct = default` parameter to all public async methods
- **Effort:** 2-3 days

### QUICK WINS (High-impact, low-effort)

#### Q1: Dispose DashboardViewModel on Page Unload

- **Finding:** `DashboardViewModel` implements `IDisposable` but `DashboardPage.Unloaded` never calls `Dispose()`
- **Fix:** Add `(DataContext as IDisposable)?.Dispose();` to `DashboardPage_Unloaded`
- **Effort:** 5 minutes

#### Q2: Add Logging to Silent Catch Blocks

- **Finding:** `App.xaml.cs:229` catches all exceptions silently during first-run initialization
- **Fix:** Add `Debug.WriteLine` or `LoggingService.Instance.LogWarning` to empty catch blocks
- **Effort:** 15 minutes

#### Q3: Mark All Classes as `sealed`

- **Finding:** Display model classes (`ActivityDisplayItem`, `IntegrityEventDisplayItem`, `RunningTaskInfo`, `SymbolViewModel`) are not sealed
- **Fix:** Add `sealed` keyword per project coding conventions
- **Effort:** 30 minutes

#### Q4: Remove `await Task.CompletedTask` Anti-Pattern

- **Finding:** Three methods in `DashboardViewModel` use `await Task.CompletedTask` as the only async operation:
  ```csharp
  // DashboardViewModel.cs:299, 321, 341
  await Task.CompletedTask;
  ```
- **Fix:** Remove `async` from the method signature and return `Task.CompletedTask` directly, or make them synchronous void methods returning via `[RelayCommand]`
- **Effort:** 15 minutes

## DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP

### Phase 1: Foundation (Critical + Quick Wins)
**Sequence:**
1. Q1-Q4: Quick wins (1 hour total)
2. C2: Fix blocking async call (30 minutes)
3. C3: Eliminate final direct `new ConfigService()` call site (30 minutes)
4. H2: Expand interface + constructor injection adoption for remaining pages (3-4 days)
5. C1: Continue migration from singleton access to DI-first resolution (2-3 days)

### Phase 2: MVVM Extraction (High-Impact)
**Sequence:**
1. H3: Consolidate duplicate ViewModels (1-2 days)
2. H4: Create base page class (2-3 days)
3. H1: Extract ViewModels for top 10 pages (8-12 days)

### Phase 3: Polish (Medium-Impact)
**Sequence:**
1. M2: Extract display models (2-3 hours)
2. M3: Standardize logging (3-4 hours)
3. M4: Fix timer thread safety (1-2 hours)
4. M1: Replace demo data with abstraction (2-3 days)
5. M5: Add CancellationToken support (2-3 days)

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Test each phase independently** before moving to the next
2. **C1 (DI)**: Introduce incrementally — register services one at a time, validate each
3. **H1 (ViewModel extraction)**: Start with the simplest page, establish the pattern, then apply to complex pages
4. **Keep the WPF project in sync** — the WPF project has similar patterns and should receive the same improvements

### Metrics to Validate Improvements

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Code-behind LOC (top 10 pages) | 8,500+ | < 2,500 |
| ViewModel count | 5 | 20+ |
| Services with interfaces | 10 | 28+ |
| Unit tests for ViewModels | 0 | 40+ |
| Blocking async calls | 1 | 0 |
| `new ServiceName()` in Views/VMs | 1 | 0 |
| Silent catch blocks | 3+ | 0 |
