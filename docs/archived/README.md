# Archived Documentation

This folder contains historical documentation that is no longer actively maintained but preserved for reference.

## Why Documents Are Archived

Documents are moved here when they:
- Describe features or approaches that have been superseded
- Contain historical decision records whose recommendations were either implemented or rejected
- Are explicitly marked as historical in their content
- Reference technologies or patterns no longer used in the project
