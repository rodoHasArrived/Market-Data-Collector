## Document Summaries

### DUPLICATE_CODE_ANALYSIS.md

**Status:** Mostly complete, remaining work tracked in ROADMAP Phase 6

**Key Findings:**
- ~12 duplicate domain models identified (resolved)
- ~59 duplicate desktop services across WPF/UWP (partial resolution)
- HTTP client duplication (resolved)
- Provider implementation patterns (standardized)

**What Remains:**
- Service deduplication Phase 2-4 (ROADMAP 6C.2-6C.4)
- UWP platform decoupling decision (ROADMAP 6E)

---

### REPOSITORY_REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md

**Status:** Superseded by [Repository Organization Guide](../development/repository-organization-guide.md)

**Key Contributions:**
- Identified structural issues
- Proposed file organization patterns
- Documented cleanup procedures

**New Guide Improvements:**
- More comprehensive project structure documentation
- Clear dependency rules and enforcement
- Common pitfalls with solutions
- Quick reference sections

---

### consolidation.md

**Status:** Work completed

**Summary:**
- Documented need to consolidate duplicate service implementations
- Many items addressed in Phase 6 completion
- Remaining work tracked in ROADMAP Phase 6C

---

### desktop-ui-alternatives-evaluation.md

**Status:** Decision made: WPF is recommended, UWP legacy

**Key Decision:**
- WPF chosen as primary desktop platform
- UWP maintained for compatibility but not prioritized
- Cross-platform desktop (Avalonia/MAUI) deferred

**Current State:**
- WPF development active
- UWP receives maintenance only
- See [WPF Implementation Notes](../development/wpf-implementation-notes.md)

---

### uwp-development-roadmap.md

**Status:** UWP no longer primary platform

**Historical Value:**
- Documents original UWP feature planning
- Shows evolution from UWP to WPF focus
- Reference for understanding legacy UWP code

**Current Approach:**
- See [WPF Implementation Notes](../development/wpf-implementation-notes.md)
- See [Desktop Platform Improvements](../development/desktop-platform-improvements-implementation-guide.md)

---

### 2026-02 PR Summaries

**Status:** Historical snapshots from February 2026

**Purpose:**
- Document PR contents for context
- Track implementation progress
- Provide audit trail

**Current Tracking:**
- See [CHANGELOG.md](../status/CHANGELOG.md) for version history
- See [ROADMAP.md](../status/ROADMAP.md) for current status

---

### REDESIGN_IMPROVEMENTS.md

**Status:** UI redesign completed and incorporated

**Key Achievements:**
- Document expansion from 296 to 840 lines
- 12 major sections added
- Production-ready UI specification

**Current Reference:**
- [UI Redesign](../architecture/ui-redesign.md) - Current design spec
- [Desktop Layers](../architecture/desktop-layers.md) - Architecture

---

### IMPROVEMENTS_2026-02.md & STRUCTURAL_IMPROVEMENTS_2026-02.md

**Status:** Consolidated into unified improvement tracker

**Background:**
- Two separate improvement tracking documents existed (functional and structural)
- Content overlapped with different organization schemes
- Made tracking progress difficult

**Consolidation:**
- Combined into single [IMPROVEMENTS.md](../status/IMPROVEMENTS.md)
- Organized by theme (Reliability, Testing, Architecture, API, Performance, UX, Operations)
- Cross-referenced to ROADMAP.md phases
- Tracks 33 items (14 completed, 4 partial, 15 open)

**Original Content:**
- IMPROVEMENTS: 10 completed, 3 partial, 2 open, 4 new items (19 total)
- STRUCTURAL_IMPROVEMENTS: 15 architectural/code improvements

**Archived Files Preserve:**
- Historical status snapshots from Feb 2026
- Original priority matrices
- Implementation notes and findings

## When to Archive a Document

Consider archiving a document when:

1. **Work is Complete**
   - Implementation finished
   - All action items resolved
   - Information captured in permanent locations

2. **Superseded**
   - Better/newer document covers the same topic
   - Approach has changed significantly
   - Document structure improved

3. **Historical Value Only**
   - No longer referenced in active development
   - Useful for understanding past decisions
   - Not needed for day-to-day work

### Archiving Procedure

1. **Update current documentation** to cover any valuable content
2. **Create entry in this INDEX.md** with context
3. **Move document** to `docs/archived/`
4. **Update links** in other docs to point to new locations
5. **Add note** at top of archived doc pointing to replacement

---

## Unarchiving

If an archived document becomes relevant again:

1. Review the document for accuracy
2. Update outdated information
3. Move back to appropriate active directory
4. Update this index
5. Update links throughout documentation

---

## Historical Context

The Market Data Collector project has evolved significantly since its inception:

- **Early Phase:** Focus on basic data collection
- **Growth Phase:** Added multiple providers, desktop apps
- **Maturity Phase:** Architecture refinement, code cleanup
- **Current Phase:** Production readiness, optimization

These archived documents chronicle this evolution and provide insight into architectural decisions and trade-offs made along the way.
