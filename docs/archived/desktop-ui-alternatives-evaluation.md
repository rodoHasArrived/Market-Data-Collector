# Desktop UI Alternatives Evaluation

## Market Data Collector — UX Architecture Assessment

**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Status:** Evaluation Complete
**Author:** Architecture Review

---

## Executive Summary

This document evaluates alternative approaches to the current native Windows desktop application (WinUI 3 / UWP-style XAML) used by the Market Data Collector system. The evaluation prioritizes the needs of finance professionals—market analysts, traders, portfolio/risk professionals—who value **correctness, predictability, and efficiency** over visual experimentation.

**Key Finding:** The current WinUI 3 implementation is fundamentally sound. Investment should focus on strengthening the real-time data pipeline (replacing HTTP polling with WebSocket streaming) rather than framework migration.

---

## A. Current State Summary

### What WinUI 3 Does Well for Finance Users

**1. Data Density & Information Architecture**
- 47 specialized views covering the full operational spectrum
- Dashboard with metric cards, sparkline charts, and real-time counters
- Order book visualization with L2 depth heatmap, bid/ask ladders
- Data calendar with completeness heatmaps (green/yellow/red/gray cells)
- Storage analytics with pie/bar charts by symbol and type

**2. Keyboard-Centric Workflows**
- 20+ global keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+D → Dashboard, Ctrl+B → Backfill, F5 → Refresh)
- Collector control shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+S start, Ctrl+Shift+Q stop)
- Symbol management shortcuts (Ctrl+N add, Ctrl+F search, Delete remove)
- Backfill operations (Ctrl+R run, Ctrl+Shift+P pause/resume, Esc cancel)

**3. Windows Integration**
- Native MSIX packaging with enterprise deployment support
- System tray presence and notifications
- Theme integration with Windows light/dark mode
- Multi-architecture support (x86, x64, ARM64)

**4. MVVM Architecture**
- Clean separation using CommunityToolkit.Mvvm
- Observable properties with automatic binding updates
- RelayCommand pattern for user actions
- Singleton services with thread-safe initialization

**5. Comprehensive Feature Coverage**
- Real-time data viewer, charts, order book displays
- Backfill scheduling with per-symbol progress tracking
- Data quality monitoring (completeness, gaps, anomalies, latency)
- Archive management with tier migration and retention policies
- QuantConnect Lean integration for backtesting

### Where WinUI 3 Creates Friction

**1. XAML Compiler Type System Limitation**
- WinUI 3 XAML compiler rejects assemblies without WinRT metadata
- Cannot use standard `<ProjectReference>` to shared Contracts project
- **Workaround:** Source file linking (~1,300 lines included at compile time)
- Any Contracts change requires consideration of UWP linking

**2. Real-Time Data Update Limitations**
- Current implementation uses HTTP polling via `LiveDataService`, not WebSocket streaming
- No `IAsyncEnumerable<T>` visible for high-frequency data streams
- Canvas-based sparkline rendering can bottleneck with rapid updates
- `ObservableCollection<T>` lacks bulk update optimization

**3. Navigation State Loss**
- No built-in state preservation on page navigation
- Filter/sort/scroll positions reset when leaving and returning to pages
- Year selection, symbol filters do not persist across navigation

**4. Vendor Dependency**
- WinUI 3 is Windows-only with no cross-platform path
- Microsoft's desktop UI strategy has shifted multiple times (WPF → UWP → WinUI)
- Dependency on Windows App SDK release cadence

**5. Service Architecture Complexity**
- 100+ singleton services with manual initialization ordering
- Circular dependencies between some services
- No dependency injection container visible in codebase

### What Problems WinUI 3 Does Not Solve

| Problem | Current State |
|---------|--------------|
| Cross-platform deployment | Windows-only |
| Browser-based access for remote users | Requires separate web UI project |
| Mobile companion monitoring | Not supported |
| True real-time streaming (sub-100ms) | Polling architecture |
| Enterprise SSO/SAML | Not implemented |
| Multi-user collaboration | Single-user application |
| Offline-first with sync | No sync mechanism |

---

## D. Decision Guidance

### When WinUI 3 Is the Correct Long-Term Choice

**Stay with WinUI 3 if:**

1. **Windows-only deployment is acceptable** — No requirement for macOS/Linux/browser access
2. **Current functionality is sufficient** — The 47 views cover operational needs
3. **Team has XAML expertise** — Existing investment should not be discarded lightly
4. **Microsoft ecosystem commitment** — Organization standardized on Windows App SDK
5. **Source-linking workaround is tolerable** — The XAML compiler issue is annoying but solved

**Strengthen WinUI 3 investment by:**
- Adding WebSocket/SignalR streaming to replace HTTP polling
- Implementing navigation state persistence
- Adding dependency injection container
- Improving accessibility coverage

---

### When a Hybrid or Supplemental UI Makes Sense

**Add web-based supplemental UI if:**

1. **Remote access needed** — Distributed teams need to check status without VPN + RDP
2. **Mobile monitoring desired** — Quick status checks from phone
3. **Configuration by non-primary users** — IT admins configuring but not trading
4. **Different permission model** — Read-only web view for stakeholders

**Implementation approach:**
- Enhance existing web dashboard with SignalR real-time updates
- Add AG Grid for data-intensive views
- Keep native desktop for primary market data operations
- Effort: ~4-8 weeks for meaningful enhancement

---

### Conditions That Would Justify Replacement

**Consider migration away from WinUI 3 only if:**

| Condition | Recommended Alternative |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Cross-platform is mandatory (macOS traders) | Avalonia UI |
| Organization abandoning Windows | Avalonia or Electron |
| Extreme performance needs (HFT) | Qt |
| Mobile companion app required | MAUI Blazor Hybrid |
| Massive web team, no native expertise | Electron + React |
| Resource-constrained deployment environment | Tauri |

**Migration is NOT justified by:**
- Developer preference for web technologies
- Perception that XAML is "old"
- Desire to use trending frameworks
- Single developer's unfamiliarity with current stack

---

### High-Risk or Low-Value Options for Finance Users

| Option | Risk/Value Assessment |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Electron** | High resource overhead; finance users often run multiple applications simultaneously. Memory bloat (300-500MB) is problematic. Not recommended unless web expertise is only available option. |
| **Tauri** | Promising but ecosystem immaturity is concerning for mission-critical finance application. Revisit in 2-3 years. |
| **MAUI Blazor Hybrid** | WebView layer adds friction for desktop-first usage. Only justified if mobile companion is hard requirement. |
| **Qt** | Overkill unless organization has C++ expertise and extreme performance needs. Licensing costs add friction. |
| **Full web replacement** | Browser limitations (keyboard shortcuts, real-time performance, offline) make this unsuitable as primary interface for finance professionals. |

---

## Final Recommendation

For the Market Data Collector application serving finance professionals:

### Primary Path: Retain and Strengthen WinUI 3

The current WinUI 3 implementation is fundamentally sound. The source-linking workaround for the XAML compiler issue is inelegant but functional. The 47 views, keyboard shortcuts, and MVVM architecture serve finance users well.

**Priority Improvements (not replacement):**
1. Replace HTTP polling with WebSocket/SignalR streaming
2. Add navigation state persistence
3. Implement proper dependency injection
4. Complete accessibility coverage

### Secondary Path: Enhanced Web Dashboard as Supplement

Enhance the existing web dashboard for remote/mobile access scenarios. Add SignalR real-time updates and professional data grid. This complements rather than replaces the native desktop.

### Migration Paths to Keep Open

- **Avalonia UI** — If cross-platform becomes mandatory in future
- **WPF** — If WinUI 3 development stalls or Microsoft pivots again

---

## Key Insight

The primary risk is not the current technology choice but **underinvestment in the real-time data pipeline**. Addressing the polling architecture provides more user value than any framework migration.

Finance users care about:
- Data arriving quickly and correctly
- Keyboard shortcuts working predictably
- Grids handling large datasets smoothly
- System staying out of their way

All of these are achievable with the current WinUI 3 stack through targeted improvements.
