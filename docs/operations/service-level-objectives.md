# Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

This document defines the Service Level Objectives for each subsystem of the Market Data Collector. SLOs provide measurable targets for reliability, performance, and data quality, enabling consistent alert calibration and incident severity mapping.

## Error Budget Policy

### Budget Exhaustion Actions

| Budget Remaining | Action |
|-----------------|--------|
| > 50% | Normal operations |
| 25-50% | Increase monitoring frequency, review recent changes |
| 10-25% | Freeze non-critical deployments, prioritize reliability work |
| < 10% | All hands on reliability, no feature work until budget recovers |
| Exhausted | Post-incident review required, mandatory reliability sprint |

### Monthly Review

At the start of each month:

1. Review SLO compliance for each subsystem
2. Calculate remaining error budget
3. Identify SLOs at risk of exhaustion
4. Adjust alert thresholds if burn rate is too noisy
5. Update incident priority mappings if needed

## Monitoring Implementation

### Prometheus Metrics Required

```promql
# Ingestion latency (histogram)
mdc_provider_latency_seconds_bucket
mdc_provider_latency_seconds_count
mdc_provider_latency_seconds_sum

# Pipeline throughput
mdc_pipeline_events_published_total
mdc_pipeline_events_dropped_total
mdc_pipeline_queue_utilization

# Health and availability
mdc_health_status
up{job="marketdatacollector"}

# Data quality
mdc_data_quality_score
mdc_data_freshness_age_seconds

# Storage
mdc_storage_write_errors_total

# Provider connectivity
mdc_provider_connected
```

### Grafana Dashboard Panels

Each SLO should have a corresponding Grafana dashboard panel showing:

1. **Current compliance percentage** (gauge)
2. **Error budget remaining** (gauge, color-coded)
3. **Burn rate trend** (time series, last 7 days)
4. **SLO violations timeline** (annotations on time series)

### Alert Rule Integration

All alerts in `deploy/monitoring/alert-rules.yml` reference their corresponding SLO and include `runbook_url` annotations linking to `docs/operations/operator-runbook.md`.
