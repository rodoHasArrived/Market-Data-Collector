# Desktop Support Policy

## Scope

This policy defines contribution and validation expectations for desktop surfaces:

- `src/MarketDataCollector.Wpf` (**primary desktop surface**)
- `src/MarketDataCollector.Ui.Services` (shared services used by the desktop client)

## Support Level

### WPF (Primary)

WPF is the sole desktop implementation. All new features and developer workflow improvements target this platform.

Expected for WPF-affecting changes:
- Build validation of WPF project
- Desktop-focused service tests
- Documentation updates when behavior or workflow changes

## Required checks by change type

### WPF-only change
- `make build-wpf`
- `make test-desktop-services`

### Shared desktop services change (`Ui.Services` or shared contracts)
- `make build-wpf`
- `make test-desktop-services`

## Ownership and maintenance expectations

- Desktop investment should prioritize WPF path quality and iteration speed.
- Avoid introducing new coupling from shared services into platform-specific UI layers.
