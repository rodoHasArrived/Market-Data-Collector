## B. Quality Dimension Evaluations

---

### Dimension 1: Completeness

**Service:** `CompletenessScoreCalculator`

**What It Measures:**
- Percentage of expected data points received
- Coverage per symbol, data type, and time period
- Comparison against expected trading session events

**Calculation Method:**
```
Completeness Score = (Received Events / Expected Events) × 100%

Expected Events = f(symbol, session_hours, historical_average)
```

**Evaluation:**

| Strength | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Multi-dimensional | Symbol, type, and time granularity |
| Historical baseline | Uses historical averages for expectations |
| Real-time tracking | Continuously updated during session |
| Alerting integration | Triggers alerts below threshold |

| Weakness | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Expectation accuracy | Historical averages may not reflect current activity |
| Holiday handling | Special sessions need manual configuration |
| Symbol-specific variation | Some symbols naturally have fewer events |

**Recommendations:**
1. Add adaptive expectations based on recent activity
2. Integrate trading calendar for session awareness
3. Add confidence intervals to completeness scores

---

### Dimension 2: Gap Detection

**Service:** `GapAnalyzer`

**What It Measures:**
- Time periods with no data received
- Gap duration and frequency
- Gap patterns (time of day, provider correlation)

**Detection Method:**
```
Gap = No events received for > threshold duration

Thresholds (configurable):
- Trades: > 60 seconds during market hours
- Quotes: > 30 seconds during market hours
- Depth: > 15 seconds during market hours
```

**Evaluation:**

| Strength | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Real-time detection | Identifies gaps as they occur |
| Severity classification | Minor, moderate, severe based on duration |
| Root cause hints | Correlates with provider health |
| Backfill integration | Triggers gap repair requests |

| Weakness | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| False positives | Low-volume symbols may have natural gaps |
| Pre/post market | Different thresholds needed outside RTH |
| Provider variability | Some providers batch updates |

**Recommendations:**
1. Symbol-specific thresholds based on typical activity
2. Time-of-day aware thresholds
3. Provider-specific gap expectations

---

### Dimension 3: Sequence Validation

**Service:** `SequenceErrorTracker`

**What It Measures:**
- Out-of-order events (timestamp regression)
- Duplicate events (same sequence number)
- Missing sequence numbers (gaps in sequence)

**Detection Method:**
```
For each event:
  if event.sequence <= last_sequence:
    if event.sequence == last_sequence:
      → Duplicate detected
    else:
      → Out-of-order detected
  else if event.sequence > last_sequence + 1:
    → Sequence gap detected
```

**Evaluation:**

| Strength | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Per-symbol tracking | Independent sequence per symbol |
| Detailed logging | Full context for debugging |
| Metrics exposure | Prometheus counters for alerting |
| Recovery handling | Resets sequence on reconnection |

| Weakness | Detail |
|----------|--------|

| Cross-provider | Can't validate sequence across providers |
| Timestamp precision | Microsecond collisions possible |

**Recommendations:**
1. Add hash-based duplicate detection for providers without sequences
2. Implement sliding window for late arrivals (not true out-of-order)
3. Add sequence gap repair via targeted backfill

---

### Dimension 4: Anomaly Detection

**Service:** `AnomalyDetector`

**What It Measures:**

- Volume anomalies (unusual volume)
- Spread anomalies (abnormal bid-ask spread)
- Rate anomalies (unusual event frequency)

**Detection Methods:**

| Anomaly Type | Method | Threshold |
|--------------|--------|-----------|
| Price spike | % change from last | > 5% in < 1 second |
| Volume spike | Z-score vs rolling average | > 3 standard deviations |
| Spread blowout | Spread vs average | > 10x normal spread |
| Event rate | Events per second | > 5x or < 0.1x normal |

**Evaluation:**

| Strength | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Multi-signal | Monitors price, volume, spread, rate |
| Statistical basis | Z-score and percentile-based detection |
| Configurable | Thresholds adjustable per symbol |
| Logging | Full event context for investigation |

| Weakness | Detail |
|----------|--------|

| False positives | Legitimate volatility triggers alerts |
| No correlation | Each signal independent |

**Recommendations:**
1. Add market regime awareness (high/low volatility modes)
2. Implement adaptive thresholds based on recent history
3. Consider ML-based anomaly detection (isolation forest, autoencoder)
4. Add cross-symbol correlation for market-wide events

- Provider latency (estimated network delay)

**Histogram Implementation:**
```
Buckets: [1ms, 5ms, 10ms, 25ms, 50ms, 100ms, 250ms, 500ms, 1s, 5s]

Metrics:
- P50, P90, P95, P99 latencies
- Mean and standard deviation
- Max latency observed
```

**Evaluation:**

| Strength | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Full distribution | Not just averages, full percentiles |
| Per-provider breakdown | Compare latency across providers |
| Real-time updates | Continuous histogram updates |
| Prometheus export | Standard metrics format |

| Weakness | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Clock sync dependency | Requires accurate system clock |
| Exchange timestamp accuracy | Some providers estimate exchange time |
| No breakdown | Single end-to-end metric, not per-stage |

**Recommendations:**
1. Add per-stage latency breakdown (network, parse, queue, process, write)
2. Implement clock drift detection
3. Add latency percentile alerts (P99 > threshold)

---

### Dimension 6: Cross-Provider Comparison

**Service:** `CrossProviderComparisonService`

**What It Measures:**
- Price consistency across providers
- Volume consistency across providers
- Timestamp alignment
- Data availability overlap

**Comparison Method:**
```
For each time window (e.g., 1 minute):
  Collect data from all providers for symbol
  Compare:
    - Price: Max deviation from median
    - Volume: Correlation coefficient
    - Count: Events per provider
  Flag if deviation > threshold
```

**Evaluation:**

| Strength | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Multi-provider validation | Catches single-provider errors |
| Objective truth estimation | Median/consensus approach |
| Detailed reporting | Per-symbol, per-metric breakdown |
| Historical tracking | Trend analysis over time |

| Weakness | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Requires multiple providers | Not useful with single source |
| Timing sensitivity | Small clock differences cause mismatches |
| Volume attribution | Different providers count volume differently |

**Recommendations:**

| Stale quote | No update > 30 seconds | Warning |

**Evaluation:**

| Strength | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Real-time checking | Immediate detection |
| Multiple checks | Jumps, trade-throughs, staleness |
| Configurable | Per-symbol threshold overrides |
| Audit trail | All flags logged with context |

| Weakness | Detail |
