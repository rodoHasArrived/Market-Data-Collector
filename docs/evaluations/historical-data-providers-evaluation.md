# Historical Data Providers Evaluation

## Market Data Collector — Backfill Provider Assessment

**Date:** 2026-02-20
**Status:** Updated (Polygon.io documentation refresh)
**Author:** Architecture Review

---

## Executive Summary

This document evaluates the 10 historical data providers integrated into the Market Data Collector system for backfill operations. The evaluation assesses data quality, coverage, rate limits, cost, and reliability to guide provider selection and fallback chain configuration.

**Key Finding:** The current multi-provider architecture with `CompositeHistoricalDataProvider` remains well-designed. Alpaca and Polygon should be primary providers for professional use cases, with Stooq and Yahoo Finance as free-tier fallbacks. Polygon remains the preferred provider for high-quality US tick data, but plan/rate-limit assumptions should be validated against Polygon's current docs before final production sizing.

## D. Implementation Assessment

### CompositeHistoricalDataProvider

The current `CompositeHistoricalDataProvider` implementation is well-designed:

**Strengths:**
- Priority-based provider selection
- Automatic fallback on failure
- Rate limit awareness via `ProviderRateLimitTracker`
- Provider health monitoring
- Configurable retry policies

**Current Configuration (from codebase):**
```csharp
// Backfill providers are created in ProviderFactory and ordered by provider.Priority
AlpacaHistoricalDataProvider       // default priority: 5
PolygonHistoricalDataProvider      // default priority: 12
TiingoHistoricalDataProvider       // default priority: 15
FinnhubHistoricalDataProvider      // default priority: 18
StooqHistoricalDataProvider        // default priority: 20
YahooFinanceHistoricalDataProvider // default priority: 22 (last-resort fallback)
```

### Gap Analysis Integration

The `GapAnalyzer` service integrates well with backfill:
- Identifies missing data periods
- Triggers targeted backfill requests
- Validates backfill completeness
- Supports gap repair workflows

---

## E. Recommendations

### For Production Deployments

1. **Establish Alpaca account** as primary provider (free, reliable, good limits)
2. **Consider Polygon subscription** for tick-level data needs, and validate current plan entitlements in the live docs before scaling
3. **Configure IB connection** if multi-asset or international coverage needed
4. **Enable Tiingo** as reliable free-tier backup
5. **Keep Yahoo Finance** as last-resort fallback only

### For Cost-Sensitive Deployments

1. **Tiingo** as primary (generous free tier)
2. **Stooq** for international coverage
3. **Yahoo Finance** as fallback
4. **Avoid** Alpha Vantage (rate limits too restrictive)

### For Professional/Institutional Use

1. **Polygon** professional tier (institutional-grade data; confirm current recency + rate-limit entitlements)
2. **Interactive Brokers** for global coverage
3. **Nasdaq Data Link** for specialized datasets
4. **Alpaca** for redundancy

### Provider Selection by Data Type

| Data Type | Primary | Fallback |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| US Daily Bars | Alpaca | Tiingo, Yahoo |
| US Intraday | Alpaca, Polygon | IB |
| US Tick Data | Polygon | IB |
| International Daily | IB, Stooq | Yahoo |
| Crypto | Alpaca, Polygon | Tiingo |
| Forex | IB | Stooq |
| Options | Polygon | IB |

---

## F. Future Considerations

### Providers to Evaluate

| Provider | Reason to Consider |
|----------|-------------------|
| Databento | High-quality tick data, modern API |
| FirstRate Data | Historical tick data archives |
| Norgate Data | Australian and global coverage |
| EOD Historical | Cost-effective global data |
| Twelve Data | Modern API, good documentation |

### Architecture Improvements

1. **Caching layer** - Cache frequently-requested data to reduce API calls
2. **Parallel backfill** - Request from multiple providers simultaneously
3. **Data validation** - Cross-reference between providers for quality
4. **Cost tracking** - Monitor API usage costs across providers

---

## Key Insight

The multi-provider architecture provides excellent resilience and flexibility. The primary improvement opportunity is not adding more providers but rather:

1. **Optimizing cache utilization** to reduce redundant API calls
2. **Implementing cross-provider validation** to catch data quality issues
3. **Adding cost monitoring** to track and optimize API spend

The current implementation handles the complexity of 10 providers well through the `CompositeHistoricalDataProvider` abstraction.
